# GoGem

## An alternative to sitegpt.ai along with PDF support. 

This project is inspired by the well-known sitegpt.ai app. The main motive behind this project was to have a -
- highly customizable AI that
- takes ANY link as input and can then
- generate a knowledge base from that input's context
- eventually allowing you to have a conversational interface based on the specified input

We decided to have an additional feature of PDF as a knowledge base but it is already very well implemented by existing solutions. Pausing the development of this project for the time being might resume later <3

Feel free to mess around with the repo :D
